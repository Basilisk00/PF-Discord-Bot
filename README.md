# Crowd Meter Bot
This is a discord bot made with Python. It scrapes the planet fitness website's crowd meter and states how busy a location is when the bot is prompted.

The URL currently goes to the Planet Fitness in Escondido, CA on Valley Parkway.

Use pip install -r requirements.txt to get necessary libraries.
